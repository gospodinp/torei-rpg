% DRAFT VERSION


Torei is a half-finished planet out in the empty space between the galaxies.  Vast inscrutable terraforming machines rule from their ziggurats at the poles, while humans scratch out what livelihood they can around the equator.

But times have changed since the greater spacefaring society discovered Torei, and the new city-towers around the space elevator form a rich hub of intergalactic trade.  Now the powerful AIs struggle to keep the economy and ecology of the world in balance, fighting to keep their biological advances safe from scheming outsiders.  The visiting off-worlders, for their part, must learn to adjust to a society where slavery and sexual domination is the norm.

# Torei

Torei as a setting is meant to be evoked rather than defined.  It's a kinky BDSM planet inspired by both Æon Flux and Gor, but exactly how that looks is best defined by your group during play.  Your games may result in a detailed sourcebook that lays out some amazing worldbuilding, or you may re-invent it constantly as you go. 

This means that you shouldn't take this section too seriously.  If a player wants to know something about Torei, the GM should probably turn the question back to the group most of the time.  Instead of asserting a veto on the group's idea via GM fiat, it's important to [Say Yes or Roll the Dice]!

That said, there are a few elements that are probably the most helpful in defining a shared understanding of the setting.  We'll start with those:

#### High-tech and traditional BDSM are part of the Torean way of life

Torei has various forms of formal institutionalised slavery, and human relationships are often viewed through the lens of dominance and submission.  It can be loving, twisted, adventurous, or abusive.

#### The three AIs are inscrutable mad gods, keeping Torei a backwater while trying to finish its biosphere.

Torei is relatively unchanged by the mainstream human culture partly due to the power of these thinking machines.  Every unfathomable action they take appears to serve the struggle to finish the terraforming project that created the planet in the first place.

#### Torei is hard to get to from the rest of the cosmos.

Torei orbits a lonely star outside any colonised galaxy.  In a universe where travel between the stars is as routine as a train journey, going to Torei still feels like an adventure and takes a long time.

#### Torean biotech can do some amazing things.

The technology of the greater human society can do many things Toreans can't, but the biological sciences on Torei surpass anything else in the universe.  Much of this comes from the AIs' research while developing the Torean ecosystem.

#### Earth is gone and forgotten

Human culture filled the Milky Way before Torei was even constructed, and is so vast that no one probably even knows for sure where we originated.  Dragging Earth into things just makes everything feel smaller.  After all, can you name the exact spot in Africa where the first human family lived?

### The Star

Torei orbits a lone hypervelocity star near Andromeda, which is why the greater spacefaring human civilisation didn't discover it for so long.  While it's reachable from Andromedan stars, the journey is expensive and time-consuming.  It should take at least a few months of subjective time for a character to cross the distance between Torei and anywhere else in the universe.

### The Space Elevator

Once in orbit around Torei, the first port of call is the space station at the top of Torei's single space elevator.  This station is run by an off-world business cartel, subject to a complex set of treaties.

At the base of the elevator, the Toreans have (with help from off-worlders) built a number of arcology spires.  This cluster of towers is the most urbanised spot on the planet.

### The Ringdoms

The habitable part of Torei covers a fairly narrow band around the planet's equator.  Because of this "ring" shape, the nations on Torei are called "ringdoms".  Each is different, and the laws can change dramatically from ringdom to ringdom.

### The Antipodes

The farther you get from the space elevator on Torei, the more rural and relaxed the pace of life becomes.  That isn't to say that life is easy out in the farming ringdoms, but there is a dramatic contrast with the dense urban core.

### The Ministries

Despite the differences in ringdoms, they all have common international institutions known as ministries.  Local management may differ radically, but the various ministries do try to coordinate worldwide.

Here's a few of the most common ones:

#### Ministry of Truants

This organisation manages the capture and punishment of those found to be in violation of slavery or curfew laws.  They manage the return of runaway slaves, and perform the role of a local police force in many ringdoms.

#### Ministry of Improvements

This organisation is a sort of hospital infrastructure that makes heavy use of Torean [Biotech].  It is most commonly associated with cosmetic enhancements, performance improvements, and the installation of devious implants.

#### Ministry of Wombs

This organisation tracks the status and records of women on Torei.  They regulate trade unions, issue travel passes to applicants, register debts, and perform appraisals for the slave markets.

### The Badlands

Most of the surface of the planet between the equatorial band and the poles is a harsh wasteland.  The terraforming project struggles to claim this area, bit by bit, for human settlement.  For anyone looking to hide, the badlands are an obvious (if dangerous) choice.

### The Ziggurats

At Torei's two poles stand vast black artificial mountains built by the AIs that fashioned Torei.  The polar Ziggurats, Dahom to the North and Mazos to the South, house the biomechanical engines that isolate elements from the planet's mantle to generate a breathable atmosphere.

Humans live within these enormous hives, and the unluckiest of them are placed inside sensory control suits called *isolation laminates* to become the Emissaries of the AIs.  Equatorial Toreans often refer to these Emissaries as "dæmons".

# Character Creation

You play humans from the greater intergalactic civilization, come to Torei for your own motives both public and secret.

#### Male or Female?

On Torei, your sex is extremely important.  Female Toreans outnumber males 9:1, and the whole economy runs on contracted and enslaved female labour.  Males often live lives of aristocratic privilege, but their status as breeding studs often complicates their [Relationships].

As an outsider, your life will have been different from that of a native Torean.  Think of how your experience of being a man or a woman (or however you identify) was different from that on Torei.

#### Where Are You From?

Invent a new planet around some new star in a nearby galaxy, and make that your homeworld.  Or perhaps it's a union of worlds that you think of as your nationality.  Be creative!

> Remember that [Earth is gone and forgotten]!

#### Why Did You Leave?

 1. Why did you come to Torei?
 2. What reason do you tell people?

These are often two different things!

## Hierarchy

#### Whose power do you represent?

Torei is fond of hierarchy.  Everyone is beneath someone and above others.  What power do you serve or represent, that brought you to this world?

#### Who represents your power?

Status on Torei comes from the people you command.  Are you a manager?  An officer?  A parent?  Do you have elected status in any organization, no matter how small?

## Background

To make a character, one of the first things you must choose is which of the five background types your character has.  Try to pick the one that best describes your character.

##### Well-Rounded
You're straightforward, adaptable, and well-balanced.  Just the sort of person to set out to seek her or his fortune on a frontier world like Torei.

##### Strong History
You're well educated, trained, or experienced.  You're on Torei because something about your history makes you the best choice for the trip.

##### Complicated History
You've had a troubled past, or a series of events left their mark on you.  You're likely on Torei to grow past these problems, or to find a solution.

##### Strong Connections
You're socially adept and a good former of friendships and alliances.  You may have come to Torei as a diplomat or a trader, to try and connect the Toreans to some off-world concern.

##### Complicated Connections
You're socially vulnerable, and your [Relationships] tend to be messy.  You may have gone to Torei to get away from someone, or to try and heal a bond with others who came before you.

## Stats

Everyone has four Stats, represented as sets of six-sided dice to be rolled during play.

###### Acuity {.stat .content-box}
![Acuity represents your intellect, perception, fine motor control, and finesse.](icons/lorc/originals/svg/brainstorm.svg)

It comes into play when doing something that requires attention to detail or delicate accuracy (talking, shooting, difficult piloting, picking pockets).

###### Body {.stat .content-box}
![Body represents your health, lust, stamina, and physical ability.](icons/lorc/originals/svg/strong.svg)

It comes into play when performing a physically demanding task (running, lifting, dancing, wrestling, swordfighting).

###### Heart {.stat .content-box}
![Heart represents your empathy, motivation to improve, and desire to help others.](icons/lorc/originals/svg/shining-heart.svg)

It comes into play when competing in a more indirect or non-violent way (talking, racing, working, dancing).

###### Will {.stat .content-box}
![Will represents your determination, resolve, nerves, and desire to dominate others.](icons/lorc/originals/svg/burning-passion.svg)

It comes into play when competing directly against someone else in an attempt to best them (wrestling, swordfighting, shooting, dogfighting, breaking a slave).

## Traits

Your Traits are aspects of your character that help you get what you want.  You can express Traits as narrative descriptions, skills, quotes, or even flaws. There are no set Traits to choose from. You make them up!

The most useful Traits are the ones that make the best narrative hooks.  The more ways you can justify a trait's relevance in a given situation, the more often you will be able to bring your trait into play.  A good trait will be evocative, without being too specific to be useful or too generic to describe your character.  

> You might want to check out the [Example Character] to get some ideas.

## Relationships

A relationship is a strong connection between your character and a person, place, organisation or fetish.  Relationships are very similar to [Traits] in that they grant you dice for use in a [Conflict], but only if the relationship is involved in the *stakes*. 

The GM will tell you when you should roll a Relationship's dice at the beginning of a [Conflict], typically because the target of your Relationship is already directly involved.

> Each character should take at least one Relationship with one of the other players' characters.

[Relationship]: #relationships

### Allocate your dice

Your [Background] type determines what dice you have to allocate.  Remember that [Stats] have a minimum of `2`{.d6} and you can't mix die sizes in [Traits] or [Relationships].

------------------------------------------------------------------------
               Background   Stat Dice   Trait Dice    Relationship Dice
-------------------------  -----------  ------------  ------------------
           [Well-Rounded]   `17`{.d6}   `1`{.d4}      `4`{.d6}
                                        `4`{.d6}      `2`{.d8}
                                        `2`{.d8}

         [Strong History]   `13`{.d6}   `3`{.d6}      `1`{.d4}
                                        `4`{.d8}      `4`{.d6}
                                        `3`{.d10}     `2`{.d8}

    [Complicated History]   `15`{.d6}   `4`{.d4}      `5`{.d6}
                                        `2`{.d6}      `2`{.d8}
                                        `2`{.d10}

     [Strong Connections]   `13`{.d6}   `1`{.d4}      `4`{.d6}
                                        `3`{.d6}      `4`{.d8}
                                        `2`{.d8}      `3`{.d10}

                                                      `2`{.d8}
                                                      `2`{.d10}
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Table: Dice allocations for the five [Background] types.

#### Don't roll these dice yet!  

Your character sheet will actually list the sets of dice themselves next to your [Stats], [Traits], and [Relationships].  If this isn't clear, see the [Example Character] later on.

#### Save Some Relationship Dice!

Most characters should leave their [Relationship] dice largely unallocated.  You'll add them in as you meet people during play!

## Belongings

Does your character carry anything?  Tools of the trade?  Restraints?  Whips?  Vibrators?


Try to work out where the belonging was made, and whether it's terrible or excellent.

> A belonging is only excellent if people meeting your character would notice
> and comment on it: "Now that is a masterpiece of a whip!" or "Aren't you
> worried someone will steal that?"

##### Torean Objects

---------    -------------------------------------------------------
 `1`{.d6}    if it’s Torean.
 `2`{.d6}    if it’s excellent Torean equipment. 
 `1`{.d4}    if it’s terrible.
--------------------------------------------------------------------

##### Off-World Objects

---------    -------------------------------------------------------
 `1`{.d8}    if it’s from off-world.
 `2`{.d8}    if it’s excellent off-world equipment.
 `1`{.d4}    if it’s terrible.
--------------------------------------------------------------------

##### Biotech

---------    -------------------------------------------------------
 `2`{.d4}    if it's Torean biotech.
 `3`{.d4}    if it's excellent Torean biotech.
 `4`{.d4}    if it's Torean biotech from the AIs.
 `1`{.d4}    if it’s terrible.
--------------------------------------------------------------------


Your character starts out with **one** special belonging of your choice.  *It must be something your character can wear with a catsuit*.  That means anything that would fit on a utility belt, in your boot, as a bracelet or pendant, tucked behind your ear, or however you might keep something on your person without having to hold on to it.  

Anything else, you need to find, steal, buy or borrow.  Most of the time, we can just assume that you use what is at hand. 

> The game is about your *character*, not your gear, so don't get too caught up in Belongings!


### Guns are complicated

Guns are the one place where die sizes are mixed: all guns get an extra `1`{.d4} in addition to whatever else they have.  This means that an excellent off-world gun would be `2`{.d8} `1`{.d4}, and an ordinary Torean gun would be `1`{.d6} `1`{.d4}.  A terrible gun would be `2`{.d4} no matter where it was made.

## Initiation to Torei

You may not necessarily be an insider on Torei yet, but you've been there long enough for it to make its mark on you.  Consider the period between your arrival on Torei and the start of play, and write down something you hope to have accomplished.

Perhaps you hope that you got out of debt, or broke a slave's will, or resisted falling in love with an abuser.  Whatever you choose, make sure it isn't something that would ruin your character if you lose.  "I hope that I didn't die" won't work!

The GM will run a [Conflict] between your character and `4`{.d6} `4`{.d10} in opposition.  The result will be a new `1`{.d6} trait, such as "I stayed debt-free ever since the belt came off" or "I never did earn my slave's respect."


# Conflict

##### Do you want something, but someone is stopping you?
Say "conflict"!

##### What are you fighting over?
That's the *stakes*.

##### Who was in the scene when you said "conflict"?
They can join in. Characters who join later can [Help].

## Roll Stats and Relationships

The first step is to roll the dice from two of your [Stats].  All your rolls go into a pool of dice in front of you, where everyone can see.

Which two [Stats] you roll depends on how you're trying to get what you want:

###### Talking {.action .content-box}

![If you're *talking*, everyone involved will roll [Acuity] + [Heart].](icons/lorc/originals/svg/conversation.svg)

###### Moving {.action .content-box}

![If the competition is *physical*, you roll [Body] + [Heart].](icons/lorc/originals/svg/sprint.svg)

###### Fighting {.action .content-box}

![If it's *violent*, you roll [Body] + [Will].](icons/lorc/originals/svg/crossed-swords.svg)

###### Manoeuvring {.action .content-box}

![ If it's a contest of *skill and finesse*, roll [Acuity] + [Will].](icons/lorc/originals/svg/on-target.svg)

### Are Your Relationships at Stake?

Roll the dice now for any [Relationships] involved in the [Conflict].

Don't roll your [Traits] or [Belongings] yet!

#### Who Goes First?

The person with the 2 highest rolled dice makes the first [Challenge]. If multiple people are involved, always pick the person who has the next 2 highest dice.

#### Who Wins?

The last person in the [Conflict] wins, and tells us what happens to the stakes.

Everyone then discards all remaining dice, and rolls [Fallout]. 

## Challenge

##### 1st Die {.col-md-offset-2 .die .bg-info .content-box}
![Push one die if that's all you have left.](icons/delapouite/dice/svg/perspective-dice-six-faces-random.svg)

##### 2nd Die {.die .bg-info .content-box}
![But if you have at least two dice, you must push two.](icons/delapouite/dice/svg/perspective-dice-six-faces-random.svg)

### Push forward any 2 dice from your pool.

> Never push more than two in a [Challenge]!


### The higher the total on the dice, the better.

1) If you don't have any dice to push forward, you *lose*.
2) Describe how you try to get what you want.  It must be something the targets *can't ignore*.
3) Each target makes a [Response].
4) After all responses are done, discard these dice.

When narrating your [Challenge], remember that pushing forward high numbers would represent powerful actions with excellent chances for success.   Low numbers are described by more bumbling attempts that might open you to counterattack (or counterargument).

## Response

The target of the [Challenge] pushes forward enough dice to match the total from the [Challenge].

###### 1 Die {#reversing-the-blow .die .bg-success .content-box}
![If you met the challenge with only one die, you're [Reversing The Blow].  Describe how you turn your challenger's actions to your advantage, and then re-use this die in your next [Challenge]!](icons/lorc/originals/svg/shield-reflect.svg)

###### 2 Dice {#blocking .die .bg-warning .content-box}
![If you met the challenge with exactly two dice, you've [Blocked].  Describe how you prevented the challenger from affecting you.](icons/lorc/originals/svg/arrows-shield.svg)

###### 3 Dice {#taking-the-blow .die .bg-danger .content-box}
![If you use three dice to meet the [Challenge], you're [Taking the Blow].  Describe how the challenger's actions harmed you, and set aside three [Fallout Dice] to roll after the [Conflict]!](icons/lorc/originals/svg/broken-shield.svg)

###### ..or more! {.die .bg-danger .content-box}
![The more dice you use in your [Response], the more [Fallout Dice] you need to roll. This can lead to greater harm, but also greater [Experience].](icons/lorc/originals/svg/broken-shield.svg)

[Reversing the Blow]: #reversing-the-blow
[Reverses the Blow]: #reversing-the-blow
[Blocking]: #blocking
[Blocked]: #blocking
[Block]: #blocking
[Blocks]: #blocking
[Taking the Blow]: #taking-the-blow
[Take the Blow]: #taking-the-blow

### Fewer Dice is Better

The outcome of the challenge depends on how many dice were used to respond.

Most of the time you will try to avoid taking [Fallout].  But sometimes, when the stakes are too high, you have to give it all you've got no matter the cost!

## Fallout Dice

Each time you [Take the Blow], you need to set aside a number of dice equal to the number you used in your [Response].  The type of these dice depends on the riskiness of blow you just took.

###### Safe {.action .bg-success .content-box}

![If the blow is *not physical*, set aside **at least** `3`{.d4}.](icons/lorc/originals/svg/screaming.svg)

###### Physical {.action .bg-info .content-box}

![If the blow *is physical* but *non-violent*, set aside **at least** `3`{.d6}.](icons/lorc/originals/svg/grab.svg)

###### Violent {.action .bg-warning .content-box}

![If the blow is *violent*, set aside **at least** `3`{.d8}.](icons/lorc/originals/svg/dripping-knife.svg)

###### Perilous {.action .bg-danger .content-box}

![If the blow is an act of *deadly force*, set aside **at least** `3`{.d10}.](icons/lorc/originals/svg/backstab.svg)

## Need more Dice?

* Get [Help]
* Use [Traits and Belongings]
* [Change the Game]

> Don't forget that [Giving In is Awesome]!

If you can't match the [Challenge]'s total, you *lose* the stakes.

After responding, discard these dice (unless you *Reversed the Blow*).



#### Change the Game

Are you shooting? Take it physical and run away! Fighting? Take it to talking with threats or bargaining. Whatever you do, it must be something the other person *can't ignore*!

> Roll Anew and Strike Back!

Everyone immediately rolls stat dice for the new type of conflict.

Don't re-roll any stats you've already rolled, and don't discard any dice already in your pool.

If you change the game to a type nobody's rolled yet, you do not need to respond, and can instead make your own [Challenge] now!

[Changing the Game]: #change-the-game

#### Traits and Belongings

1. Describe how one of your [Traits] or [Belongings] helps you.
2. Roll it and add the dice to your pool.

> You can only use each trait or belonging once per [Conflict].

#### Help

Anyone can help by describing and rolling a relevant trait or belonging, then giving you their single highest rolled die. The rest are discarded. They now can't use this trait or belonging in their next conflict.

### Give In

You can give in the stakes at any time, even when someone is challenging you. This saves you from needing to respond, and can prevent fallout!

Keep your 2 highest dice in your pool for your next conflict (don't re-roll them!) You can't help in this same conflict.


# Fallout

Fallout represents the negative consequences for participants who took a blow or two in the course of the conflict.  *Fallout does not stop you from winning the stakes*.  A general can win a battle, but die in his moment of glory.  

After a conflict, roll all your fallout dice (if any) together.

If any of these rolled dice come up `1`, you gain an [Experience]!


> You can only claim one experience per conflict.


Then take the two highest fallout dice you rolled and add them together.  Choose harm from the following table:

2-7
~    Take [Short-Term Harm]
8-10
~    Take [Short-Term Harm] and one [Scar]
11-15
~    Take [Short-Term Harm] and [Trauma]
16-19
~    Take [Short-Term Harm] and [Trauma], *and* enter a [Conflict] where the stakes are your own survival.
20
~    *Death!*  Describe how you exit the game.

> *Death!* doesn't need to be literal death.  Anything that takes your
> character out of the story permanently will do.

## Short-Term Harm

Short-Term Harm reduces the die size of one of your [Stats] for at least the next [Conflict], or until you've succeeded at some attempt to clear it.  Choose the one that is most likely to have resulted from the blows you took:

###### Dazed {.harm .bg-danger .content-box}

![Dazed reduces the die size of your [Acuity] from `#`{.d6} to `#`{.d4}.](icons/lorc/originals/svg/six-eyes.svg)

###### Bound {.harm .bg-danger .content-box}

![Bound reduces the die size of your [Body] from `#`{.d6} to `#`{.d4}.](icons/lorc/originals/svg/imprisoned.svg)

###### Broken {.harm .bg-danger .content-box}

![Broken reduces the die size of your [Will] from `#`{.d6} to `#`{.d4}.](icons/lorc/originals/svg/despair.svg)

###### Shamed {.bg-danger .harm .content-box}

![Shamed reduces the die size of your [Heart] from `#`{.d6} to `#`{.d4}.](icons/lorc/originals/svg/paranoia.svg)

## Scar

The gentlest form of permanent harm is a Scar, physical or emotional.  It will complicate your struggles in the future, but can build slowly into a reserve of strength.

* Take a new `1`{.d4} Trait or Relationship.
* Or add `1`{.d4} to an existing Trait or Relationship.

## Trauma

Trauma is what begins to undo you as a character.

* Remove `1`{.d6}, `1`{.d8}, or `1`{.d10} from anywhere on your sheet.
* Or reduce the die size of a Trait or Relationship by 2.

## Experience

Per the circumstances of the story, choose one:

* Gain a `1`{.d6} trait, relationship, or belonging.
* Add one die to an existing trait, relationship, or belonging.
* Add 2 to the die size (max: 10) of an existing trait, relationship, or belonging.


# Play Advice

#### How to Think about Dice

Lots of small dice can win you the stakes, but they're more likely to harm you. It's true that `3`{.d4} can total up to `12` just as `2`{.d6} can, but needing 3 dice to respond instead of 2 increases your [Fallout]. So having that fistful of `#`{.d4} can win you the stakes, but you will pay for it later!

#### How to Think about Fallout

Fallout also has a die-size element to it, keyed to the type of conflict you're engaged in. The smaller dice used for the non-violent conflict types make it more likely that some of them will come up `1`, earning you an [Experience]. We learn more consistently by talking or doing than we do by fighting, after all!

#### How to Think about Changing The Game

The original games that inspired this one called [Changing the Game] *escalation*, and that confused a lot of new players.

It's true that you can escalate from peaceful approaches to more violent ones, but what's most important is that the current approach won't work for you and you're not willing to give up the stakes.

> A pirate who breaks from a swordfight to swing from the chandelier is [Changing the Game] every bit as much as a cowgirl who draws her pistol on an argument!


#### Giving In is Awesome

If you're willing to surrender the stakes, giving in can be one of the most powerful moves you have! You get to keep your two best rolls in your pool, and use them in your next [Conflict]. You also avoid any further risk of [Fallout], and this can help you aim for [Experience].

A submissive character may well play a long game of rope-a-dope, giving in to a dominant character regularly just to gain the upper hand on the next [Conflict].

Consenting to submit as a beneficial game mechanic: it's one of the reasons the Torei RPG uses these rules!

## Example Character


Stellanova is a character from the *Stella of the Bailey* series of stories.  Since the stories are largely about how Stella's friends and relations drag her into complex situations, I'll just pick [Complicated Connections] for her template.

Stella's a paralegal of some sort: highly professional, highly skilled at negotiation. She's got a strong force of personality and a clever wit. She was married to the Amalthean ambassador to Torei, her ex-wife Sophie. Sophie has two nieces she takes care of, who have just come of age. Stella purchased a slave maid for Sophie's apartment a long time ago, after they broke up. Sophie comes from a mixed family: her (late) father was from Hotchkiss, and her mother from Amalthea. She lives in Motka tower, but Sophie's family lives in Alem tower.

Table: Stella's [Relationships]

### I Hope I Protected Someone From a Bully

Stella's a slightly idealistic champion for the underdog, so she chose "I hope I protected someone from a bully" as her hope for the [Initiation to Torei] [Conflict].

> Stella is on a train late at night, and a young man boards.  He's got an eye
> for a young woman who's travelling to work graveyard shift at one of the
> tower casinos, and he steps over to her to have a word.  The casino girl does
> her best to respectfully decline his advances, but he ignores this and grabs
> her.

Now we're in the situation, and it's time for Stella to react!  Being a legal mind, she tries to persuade this man that he doesn't want to keep molesting this working girl.

> Stella shouts to the bully: "Leave her alone!"

Since this persuasion is just [Talking], that means that Stella rolls her [Heart] and [Acuity] dice now for a total of `9`{.d6}.  None of her [Relationships] are at stake, so she leaves those alone.

Because this is part of [Character Creation], the GM doesn't build a character for this one-off bully but instead rolls `4`{.d6} `4`{.d10}.  So the results are:

Stella
:   `1` `1` `2` `4` `1` `4` `4` `1` `1`
Bully
:   `6` `6` `3` `4` `1` `7` `10` `10`

Ouch!  Unlucky roll for Stella, and lucky for the bully!

Now it's time to use these results as currency to tell a story.  The Bully's roll is vastly better than Stella's, but Stella still has [Traits] she can use to add more dice as necessary.

[Who Goes First?]  Since the Bully's two highest dice (`10` `10`) beat Stella's (`4` `4`), he goes first.  He puts forth a [Challenge] with `3` `4`:

Bully's [Challenge]
:   `3` `4`

> "Keep your off-world tongue to yourself!" the bully spits back.  "I'll train
> it properly once I'm done with this meat here!" He leers at Stella.

Now the bidding war starts back and forth.  Stella must do two things: push forward enough dice for her [Response] to meet or exceed `7` (the total from the Bully's [Challenge]), and then push forward a [Challenge] of her own.  Unfortunately, she can't do it with fewer than three dice, so she'll have to [Take the Blow].

Stella's [Response]
:   `2`{.bg-danger} `4`{.bg-danger} `1`{.bg-danger}
[Fallout Dice]
:   `3`{.d4}

> Stella shrinks a bit under the bully's stare, clearly uncomfortable.

Stella can't succeed with these terrible dice.  It's time to use her [Traits and Belongings].  Stella calls on `2`{.d6} for *Years on Torei made me a fearless negotiator* and `1`{.d8} for *expert in Torean human rights and treaty law*.  These dice come up `6` `6` `6`, so the balance now looks like:

Stella
:   ~~1 2 4~~ `4` `4` `1` `1` `1` `1` `6` `6` `6`
Bully
:   ~~3 4~~ `6` `6` `1` `7` `10` `10`


Stella's [Challenge]
:   `6` `6`

> Stella narrows her eyes and snaps back, "That woman works for the Motkan
> tourism board, and has a fully protected contract with the
> Tower Authority.  You have no right to cajole any consideration from her
> that would be in conflict with the standards of conduct required by her
> employer."

The bully [Blocks] with two dice:

Bully's [Response]
:   `6`{.bg-warning} `6`{.bg-warning}

> "I am a red-blooded male of Torei.  Don't tell me my rights,
> freewomb!"  

Bully's [Challenge]
:   `7` `1`

> The bully ignores Stella's legalese and begins molesting the whimpering
> woman.

Again, this isn't working out with the dice she has.  She needs to [Change the Game] and try to stop him physically.  She thus ignores the current [Challenge] and rolls `4`{.d6} `2`{.d6} to bring her [Body] and [Will] in for the fight, and decides to tap `1`{.d6} for *I let my...frustration get the better of me.*  The result of these rolls is `6` `4` `3` `2` `3` `1` `6` which takes the total to:

Stella
:   ~~1 2 4 6 6~~ `4` `4` `1` `1` `1` `1` `6` `6` `4` `3` `2` `3` `1` `6`
Bully
:   ~~3 4 6 6 1 7~~ `10` `10`

Stella's Challenge
:   `6` `4`

> Stella runs toward the man in frustration at being ignored.  She grabs the
> man by one arm in an attempt to pry him away from the poor girl.

But since `10` was the biggest raise we could do, the bully [Reverses the Blow].

Bully's [Response]
:   `10`{.bg-success}

> The man twirls around the moment he is touched, and soon he has Stella in his
> arms. 

Bully's [Challenge]
:   `10`{.bg-success} `10`

> He spins her around and whips some sort of handcuffs out of a back pocket of
> his trousers, forcing Stella's arms around a pole behind her back!*

### FIXME: Bogus old notes follow

That's all of the bully's dice, so if we can see `20` and raise *anything* we'll save this poor girl.  Unfortunately our dice are so terrible that the fallout will be considerable (and it's d6es because this is now physical combat!).

> **See: 6 6 2 3 3 Fallout: `5`{.d6}**  Stella grunts in pain as her shoulders
> are wrenched roughly back, her elbows pinned together behind the pole.
> She withers under the bully's breath as he gloats in her face.
> **Raise: 1 1** Gasping with despair, she sees her opportunity when the
> train comes into a station: the doors open, and the bully turns around
> briefly to resume tormenting the working girl.  Grasping the pole behind
> her with her hands, Stella lifts up her knees and kicks out at the man.

Now *everyone* is out of dice, but the important thing is that Stella put
forth a *raise* that the bully can't *see*.  He's lost the stakes (whether
or not he bullies the girl)!

> Stella's kick hits true, and the bully stumbles and trips as he tries to
> regain his balance.  He tumbles drunkenly out of the train, and takes just
> a little too long to stand up: by the time he's on his feet, the train
> doors have closed.  Stella gasps with adrenaline rush and grins widely as
> she and the casino girl watch the gesticulating man and the platform he
> stands on zip out of sight together.
>
> "That was so very brave of you!" coos the girl, draping her arms over
> Stella's tortured shoulders.  "Of course, I'll bet someone as clever as
> you already worked it out, but you just won me in honest combat.  I'm
> yours for an elevenight."
>
> The girl leans in and plants a kiss on Stella's lips that starts soft and
> tender, but melts quickly into fiery passion.  Stella strains against her
> bonds, but she isn't sure if it's to push the girl away or to hold her
> closer.

So Stella won!  What now?  Well now she gets a new *Trait*:

 * `1`{.d6} I once saved a girl from a bully.

But it didn't come easy: we *took the blow* twice, earning `1`{.d4} `5`{.d6} in
fallout!  I roll them and come up with **3 3 2 2 3 6**.  I take the two
highest which total **9**.  Since this is more than 8, I need to mark down
some permanent harm: I could reduce die sizes or subtract dice from stats or
traits, but an appealing alternative is to take on `1`{.d4} for a trait or
relationship.

The two things that would make the most sense given this scene would be to
take a trait about the after-effects of the elbow cuffs, or to take the
working girl as a relationship.  As fitting as the relationship seems (given
that it was the stakes of the conflict) I think I'll go with:

 * `1`{.d4} I once spent the whole night bound uncomfortably in a train
   carriage.

And with that, we've finished Stella's character!

# GM Advice

## Say Yes or Roll the Dice

This is critical for driving gameplay toward [Conflict].  If you take nothing else from this section, it should be this mantra.  *Say yes, or roll the dice!* Write it at the top of your notes.

The role of GM in a story-building and world-building game like this one is a lot more participatory than in some popular systems.  Keeping players involved and having fun is more important than simulating a strict system of carefully-balanced statistics or plot elements.

So when one or more of your players want to do something that you don't think is a good idea, that should mean that one or more *NPCs* object.  Have them declare a [Conflict] and start rolling dice.  You will be pleasantly surprised where the story takes you!

And if you're not willing to get out the dice and turn it into a [Conflict], then just say yes!  It obviously wasn't that important, or you'd have made the players work for it.

This idea is so central that I'll repeat it once more:

> Say yes, or roll the dice!

#### Build Situations, Not Plots

It's tempting to think like an author, building a story with a beginning middle and end.  Unfortunately that rarely results in a satisfying gameplay experience.

Players want to feel that they're exploring a world and building a story as they go.  The plot should be the product of everybody's participation, and not just a secret tale the GM reveals as the players pass certain tests.

So instead of laying out what should happen during the game, build a few NPCs and some [Relationships] between them.  Find what forces and obligations would drive one of them to desperation, and their desperate act will be the kernel of a situation that affects the NPCs they share [Relationships] with.

Build a rough sketch of events leading up to the appearance of the players, and let them discover the dilemmas and crises as the NPCs react to their problems.

#### Share the Setting

Another common mistake is to spend time drawing out elaborate maps and city plans for the players to explore.  Or to itemise all of the social rules for a new type of NPC you've introduced.

It's far better to invite the players to narrate setting details.  If a player is running through a city, have her describe the neighbourhood she's sprinted into.  If a player is at a street market, let him invent a whole ringdom from which the other trader hails.  The more colour your players add to the story, the more inspiration you may find for the NPCs.

Ask idle players for input on the details of the active player's interactions.  Keep everyone alert and involved in the story.

Let the players describe Torei itself as they interact with it.  Then you should [Say Yes or Roll the Dice]!

### Keep Revealing

If you [Build Situations, Not Plots], then you may be surprised to learn that even your situations shouldn't be that secret.  It's tempting to present the crises you've created as a puzzle for the players to solve.  But mystery stories only work because the author presents the clues and discoveries to the reader at a steady pace.

Don't leave the players in the dark, chasing red herrings or scratching their heads trying to find the next clue.  NPCs may be cagey or duplicitous, but they should at least send the players to an NPC who will reveal more of the facts of the situation.  Run your games as "howcatchems", not "whodunnits"!
